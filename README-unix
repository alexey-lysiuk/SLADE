SLADE3 SVN UNIX COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------
1)
Download the required libraries (most should be available in your distro's package repository):
-wxWidgets *2.9+* from <http://wxwidgets.org> (most repositories don't currently have 2.9)
-FreeImage from <http://freeimage.sourceforge.net>
-FluidSynth from <http://fluidsynth.org>
-SFML from <http://sfml-dev.org>

2)
Compile/install the required libraries if needed.

a) wxWidgets:
-Extract the wxWidgets tar
-Follow the instructions in docs/gtk/install.txt ('the simplest case'), but add '--with-opengl --enable-mediactrl' to the ../configure line
-If the above fails and says gstreamer not found, you need to install the gstreamer, gstreamer-plugins and gconf2 dev packages

b) FreeImage:
-Extract the FreeImage tar
-Follow the instructions in README.linux (to install normal FreeImage, not FreeImagePlus)

3)
To compile SLADE3, there are two ways to go about it: either install CodeLite IDE and use that, or build it using CMake

a) IDE Compilation
-Download and install CodeLite IDE from <http://codelite.org>
-Run CodeLite
-Select Workspace->Switch to workspace... and select 'SLADE.workspace' in the trunk directory of the SLADE SVN
-Select Release configuration from the drop-down box on the workspace view if it isn't already selected
-Click the 'Build Active Project' button on the toolbar

b) CMake Compilation
-Make sure cmake is installed <http://cmake.org>
-cd to the 'dist' directory
-Enter the following commands: 'cmake ..' then 'make'

4) Build slade.pk3

If you build SLADE3 with cmake, the essential slade.pk3 will also be
built for you. The only requirement is that you have either 7z or zip
programs in your path. This will also work on MS Windows.

7z is preferred as it's faster at checking if any modifications
need to be done to existing archive.

If you have neither program, or choose not to use cmake, you can build
slade.pk3 manually by zipping up contents of dist/res directory.


And that should be it. There are some more detailed instructions on the SLADE wiki here: http://slade-editor.wikia.com/wiki/Compilation

OTHER SLADE3 UNIX ISSUES
------------------------
Ubuntu 11.04:
wxWidgets 2.9.1 has some issues with Ubuntu 11.04. These are fixed in wxWidgets 2.9.2 on the wx SVN. Instructions
for checking out the wxWidgets svn can be found here: <http://www.wxwidgets.org/develop/svn.htm>. The compilation
instructions for 2.9.1 above also apply for 2.9.2.
